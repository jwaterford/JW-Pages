# Computational Analysis of Ecological and Trancriptomic Data

The goal of this page is to document the tools in rStudio are best used for analyzing large sets of ecological data. While the current scope of the webpage is limited to ecological data, I would greatly like to extend toward other areas of statistical analysis, considering the importance of transcriptomic analysis of endangered marine life.

Analyzing large sets of ecological data is crucial for understanding the complex interactions within ecosystems and developing evidence-based strategies for conservation and management. Large data sets allow for more robust statistical analysis and modeling, providing valuable insights into the functioning of ecosystems, assisting in the identification of important patterns and relationships. This is useful for effective monitoring of changes  in biodiversity and ecosystem services.

## Current Projects

 - Quantitative analysis on the restoration of native vegetation in agricultural landscapes and its effects on reversing the loss of biodiversity.
 

## Future Project Goals

 - Analyzing transcriptomic data of endangered marine life (currently coral) exposed to strong environmental factors
 
 - Studying the microevolution of marine fish due to multiple strong anthropgenic selectors (oil spills, over-fishing, water temperature).
